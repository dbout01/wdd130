        <h3>Sparkling & Dry White</h3>
        <p>
          What exactly is white wine? White wine is wine that is white, but it's
          defining characteristic is light fruity flavors derived from white
          and/or green grapes. Sparkling wine is exactly what it sounds like!
          It's wine with bubbles, colloquially known as “bubbly”. Dry white wine
          is white wine, but it has a lot of something called “tannins”, or
          something that makes the wine have a 'dry' feeling in your mouth. The
          average alcohol content of both kinds is around 10% per-bottle. Since
          these varieties aren't as aged as redder wines, you'll be set-back
          around $8-$18, depending on the quality. Our picks: Cava, Brut,
          Moscato.

        <h3>Sweet White & Rich White</h3>
        <p>
          Sweet white wine is white wine that's, well., sweet. Rich white wine
          is white wine that is sweet, but very sweet. The average alcohol
          content of both kinds is around 12% per-bottle. Since these varieties
          aren't as aged as redder wines, you'll be set-back around $8-$18,
          depending on the quality. Our picks: Pinot Grigio, Champagne, Rosé.
        </p>

      <div id="div4">
        <h3>Light Red & Medium Red</h3>
        <p>
          What exactly is red wine? Red wine is wine that is red, but its
          defining characteristic is more bold, flavorful fruity flavours
          derived from red and/or purple grapes. Light red wine is red wine, but
          like light white wine, it goes easy on the flavor. Medium red is a
          step-up rom a light red, but isn't as strong as a bold red. The
          average alcohol content of both kinds is around 13% per-bottle. Since
          these varieties are a little more aged than white wines, you'll be
          set-back around $10-$30, depending on the quality. Our picks:
          Riesling, Pinot Noir, Syrah.
        </p>

      <div id="div5">
        <h3>Bold Red & Dessert</h3>
        <p>
          Bold red wine is wine that explodes with flavor, and rivals even a
          rich white. Dessert wine is a type of bold wine, but it leans more on
          the sweet side with hints of nutty flavours. The average alcohol
          content of both kinds is around 15% per-bottle. Since these varieties
          are more aged than light and medium red wines, you'll be set-back
          around $15-$50, depending on the quality. Our picks: Zinfandel,
          Shiraz, Sherry, Port.
