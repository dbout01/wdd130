      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Service Business</h3>
      <p>
        As the owner of this website, I am providing a website to help customers
        feel comfortable in scheduling appointments, having access to quality
        customer service. I also want to make sure that my customers will not
        have to worry about cancellations or delays.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        I want people who enjoy the outdoors, live life in the fast lane, and go
        on last-minute excursions to feel like they have a place to go to for a
        quick appointment to fuel their passion for action. Nowadays, it is hard
        to find a service that would cater to such individuals and require them
        to book months in advance. Mobile access is this site's number one
        priority, since the people on the go always have their phones handy.
      </p>

      <h2>Style Guide</h2>

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Color Palette</h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
      <p>Palette URL:</p>
      <a
        href="https://coolors.co/d1462f-ffd9da-04471c-e1e289-1f2232"

          <th>Accent 1</th>
          <th>Accent 2</th>
        </tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
        <tr>

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, Butterfield Rafting Company
        offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood
        Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
        Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
      </p>
      <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for
        physically fit and experienced rafters. No matter what type of river
        adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it
        happen for you.
